## The challenge

Your customers want to get the best possible experience using your product. How can you customize what is displayed to them so that they are exposed to content most likely to appeal to them?


## The solution

Weaviate combines your catalogue of products and the user profile to make a customized display for each customer. The system will work with the basic details provided by new customers to make a best guess and will quickly improve the selection based on user activity. This will show them more of what they like and product they might never have discovered.
