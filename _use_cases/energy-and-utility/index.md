## The challenge

Large infrastructures require constant maintenance. This needs to be timely and effective.

## The solution

Weaviate can analyze all your new and historical maintenance data to combine: failure rates, life expectancy, knock-on failures, maintenance schedules and routes, to get the most out of your parts, equipment and staff. Items discovered to regularly fail at similar time intervals can be replaced preemptively. Items that are routinely replaced when not needed can be retained for future use. Maintenance routes of technicians can be maximized so that customers in adjacent areas can be served on the same day avoiding extra journey per customer. Equipment that fails regularly can be identified and alternative equipment sourced. Failure rates of particular parts can also be tracked to see if alternative suppliers can provide better parts.
