## The challenge

New ideas and concepts are usually based on developments in the past. Think of microwave ovens that are based on wartime radar technology, or _social media_ being based on internet technology developed in the 1960s.

## The solution

You can search for "social media" in documents of any age and Weaviate will find the relevant ones in documents with and without the term "social media". Weaviate gives you the possibility to research your existing document archive and open source archives with recent search terms.
It is particularly powerful in legal documents where modern concepts are not referred to by name (in documents written before the name existed) but are still relevant. Examples could be concepts like _doxxing_ or _phishing_. You could also search through the vast historical literature on linguistics to discover documents relevant to semantic machine learning.
Weaviate's knowledge graph applied to a document store will use its semantic tools to create a searchable knowledge store where words are conceptually linked to search terms.
