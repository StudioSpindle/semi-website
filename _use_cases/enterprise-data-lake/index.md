## The challenge
Enterprise data environments are vast, complex and fundamentally messy. Your business has a huge amount of data from multiple different sources with different levels of completeness and quality. Creating a data lake only collects the data in one place but doesn't make it more useful. Fitting the data to a data model is impossibly resource intensive.

## The solution
Weaviate can absorb all your data into one intelligent information source, getting the maximum value out of all quality levels without manual processing of each data point. Reasoning and inference are possible because the knowledge graph has structured the data semantically.

## How did we help
Combining your knowledge of your business and our Weaviate consultancy we work together to create a network of Weaviate knowledge graphs for you that couple together to form a single powerful unit. Each domain gets its own Weaviate so that things like customers, products, inventory, assets etc. are gathered together to produce a massive Enterprise knowledge graph.
