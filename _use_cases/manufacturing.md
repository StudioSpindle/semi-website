## The challenge

Generating quotes for complex machinery is traditionally a skilled, slow and manual task. Each quote is dealt with as a unique instance and manually done using multiple time-consuming revision and negotiation rounds. This means no instant rough estimate is possible which discourages the customer and means wasted effort by the estimating organization

## The solution

Weaviate can collect all existing quote data to form a knowledge graph of quote expertise from the manufacturer. The graph can be coupled through the Weaviate API to the company website quote-request pages. A new customer can then self-serve a quote by entering their requirements. Once data is entered by the customer, Weaviate can use existing quote information to form a ballpark quote with upper and lower limits for the customer. This increases customer retention by instantly giving a quote and allowing them to then engage with the manufacturer on the quote. This also saves the quote department all the initial manual quote time and means they can focus on quickly tightening the quotes already supplied by Weaviate.
