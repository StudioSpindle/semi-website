## The challenge

Optimizing the logistics of wholesale goods delivery to retail outlets means ensuring that as many known and potential delivery points should be visited per delivery round. What is the best way to deliver to existing customers and how can the wholesaler find new potential customers near existing ones?

## The solution

Weaviate combines geographic data of routes and existing customers with enrichment data based on mapping, traffic and routing to optimize delivery. This is further enhanced using public retail space directories to show potential customers (e.g. a food wholesaler would like to find new shops and restaurants to deliver to along its existing (optimized) delivery routestes.
