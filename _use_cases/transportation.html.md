## The challenge

Cars returning from rental or being rented out require a manual inspection for damage to ensure that insurance claims are not questioned and that both parties know of any damage caused during a rental. This process is done manually (often on paper) requiring skilled staff and training to ensure that all areas of a vehicle are checked.

## The solution

Installation of cameras to inspect the vehicle as it arrives and is ready to leave will automatically capture images of all sides of the vehicle including underneath and the roof area. If Weaviate is provided with these images it can perform 2 tasks automatically. 1 recognizing damage by using trained image analysis to find imperfections in each surface and object. 2 comparing data from previous scans will quickly show when new damage has been caused. Together these two processes are much more reliable and cost effective than manual inspection. Occasional training sessions will also improve the recognition capacity of the system so that it can be made more flexible and effective.
