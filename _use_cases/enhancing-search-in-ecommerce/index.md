## The challenge
You want to provide a seamless experience to your customers. Never lose a sale because a customer used the wrong search terms to find a product you have.

## Detail
In retail environments products are frequently endorsed by or associated with celebrities. Name recognition and branding is very powerful. For example if a famous actress endorsed a hair product in its marketing and your online shop stocked that product you need to ensure that searching for the actress' name will results in hits for products she endorses.

## The solution
You train Weaviate to understand the environment you are modelling. In this case the knowledge graph would be filled with the associations between celebrities and their endorsed products. Meaning that if Joan Crawford endorsed the Marcel Wave we would train the Weaviate to know the connection between the two names. A customer entering "I want the Joan Crawford hair stuff" would be served a result containing the Marcel Wave product.

## How did we help
Combining your knowledge of the market and our Weaviate consultancy we work together to create a knowledge graph for you that associates, in this case, people and their connected brands. The power of the knowledge graph then means supplementary associations are also available: associated products of either the person or the brand are then available to your eCommerce software to show as potential ancillary purchases.
