## The challenge

Generating quotes for complex machinery is traditionally a skilled, slow and manual task. Each quote is dealt with as a unique instance and manually done using multiple time-consuming revisions and negotiation rounds. This means no instant rough estimate is possible which discourages the customer and means wasted effort by the sales team and supporting engineers.

## Weaviate as solution

Weaviate collected all existing quote data to form a knowledge graph of quote expertise from the manufacturer. The graph coupled through the Weaviate API to the company website quote-request pages. A potential customer or sales representative can now self-serve a quote by entering their requirements. Once data is entered, Weaviate uses existing quote information to form a ballpark quote with upper and lower limits. This increases customer conversion by instantly giving a quote and allows for a quicker more efficient sales conversation. Simultaneously it frees up time for engineers calculating production costs for products that may never see the light of day. Subsequently new actual prices are automatically added to the data to increase accuracy on the quotes supplied by Weaviate.
