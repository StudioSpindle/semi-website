## The challenge

Large scale construction projects are a complex conversion of tools, people, materials and specific expertise. Any lag in one of these streams can lead to continuous delays and disruptions. These delays are often caused by miscommunication and lack of proactivity making the issue larger, rather than smaller.

## Weaviate as solution

Extra costs and delays can be mitigated by daily monitoring of images of building sites cross referenced with specific preset milestones. Weaviate can recognize progress, or lack thereof, and check this against expectations. As soon as a milestone is not met an automated message can be sent to stakeholders, preempting early/late delivery of people and tools, avoiding unnecessary costs.
