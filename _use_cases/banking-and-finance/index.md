## The challenge

Banks want to offer their customers best in class experiences. Transactional data is well understood and fully utilized in its native form. What if we could enrich the data from a transaction and give financial institutions more?

## The solution

Weaviate makes it possible to capture traditional transactional data and to enrich it with supplementary data; and then to form relationships between the traditional and enriched elements. E.g. adding data from existing transactions to cluster new ones by: size, customer type, and also for fraud detection, risk assessment.
