## The challenge

Airports are collections of organizations within a larger organization. The airport itself, baggage handlers, refueling infrastructures, customs offictials, duty free sales, catering for both the aircraft and the waiting passengers, etc. These businesses all have separate datasets. To make the airport as efficient as possible it would be ideal to combine these separate datasets without compromising security or privacy.

## The solution

Weaviate can be used by each of the organizations in the airport and the airport itself to create a local knowledge graph for each individual organization. The standalone Weaviates can then be networked together to make one _super-graph_ which combines the shared knowledge within the airport into a powerful tool for managing the whole process of getting passengers onto their aircraft efficiently and in an economically effective way. This would mean combining data for different times of the day and year including on calendar effects like school and religious holidays. Metadata on global weather and political changes which can affect travel. Metadata on quantity of luggage per traveler per country of origin/destination. Metadata on busyness of food services at different times of the day and passenger timeliness at the gates. All these and many more data points will be combined in the _super-graph_ to find out what needs to be addressed to improve the functioning of the airport.
