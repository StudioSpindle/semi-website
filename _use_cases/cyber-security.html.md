## The challenge

Distinguishing security threats and attacks from common mistakes in passwords and protocol is a time consuming task. Large corporations can sometimes spend millions of euros a year in human capital to manually go through flagged security issues. Additionally, volume based attacks meant to disrupt operations can be hard to correlate and often require a lot of time to mitigate.

## Weaviate as solution

Weaviate allows you to relate potential security breaches on a number of characteristics - either versus each other or a predefined benchmark. Weaviate does the heavy lifting when determining whether a potential security incident is intentional or a false positive. Weaviate can also quickly determine trends in volume based attacks finding similarities so that they can be prevented in the future.
