            <b>Challenge: </b> Business users create reports (e.g., financial) based on how data is structured in ERP systems. For example, a flight ticket
            from an airline needs to be classified as "international travel" but this is often not done correctly, not done at all
            or not done in a way that it works for a specific business question (e.g., an airline ticket classified as
            "international travel" can't answer the question "How much money has been spend on non-ground travel")
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>How it is solved now: </b> Businesses hire external parties to manually classify the data correctly or they do it themselves. An alternative is to
            hire data scientists to solve this problem is expensive and time-consuming.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Solution: </b> SeMI's Weaviate can be easily integrated into the existing software landscape and classify data 24/7 and near-realtime.
        </p>
