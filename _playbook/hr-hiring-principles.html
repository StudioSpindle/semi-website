        <h1>Hiring principles at SeMI</h1>
        
        <p>
            At SeMI, we believe that a diverse and motivated team leads to a broad range of skills, experience, creativity and innovation. We believe in equity and inclusion. 
            We set up our recruitment process according to the following principles:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In the job advert, we put emphasis on our values and vision: we focus on what we are doing and what we want to achieve. We seek for matching values and way of working.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We use gender-neutral and non-discriminatory language to avoid (unconscious) attraction- and selection bias. <i>"Communication is not what you say, but how it's heard".</i> In addition, there is no need for buzzwords. We focus on defining our company personality by sharing our vision, mission and values. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Contact details of at least two team members are shared in the job post, so that anyone can choose who to contact.
                </li>
                <li>    
                    We are fully transparent in who is currently working at SeMI.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
