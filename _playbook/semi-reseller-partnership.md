The following document contains the guiding principles for a SeMI Reseller Partnership. The document is not legally binding but a concrete overview of the partnership deal.

## SRP Location and Branch definitions

- A SRP operates in a fixed country or territory (e.g., Benelux or North America).
- A SRP operates in one (1) or more industries based on the [International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC)](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/Econ/Download/In%20Text/ISIC_Rev_4_publication_English.pdf) ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Industrial_Classification#ISIC_Revision_4_broad_structure)).
- A SRP gets exclusivity in a branch of the selected territory and branches.
- A SRP can represent multiple branches.
- A SRP can represent multiple countries.
- SeMI has the full right to publish SRP’s name, territory, and branch(es) on their website or in other publications.

## SRP solution scope and business scope

- A SRP partnership consists of all solutions except Weaviate open source.
- A SRP is not allowed to offer a secondary managed Weaviate service.
- A SRP offers implementation, consultancy and a sales channel in the agreed territory and branches.
- A SRP invoices customers in their territory and branch directly.

## SRP commission & pricing

- A sales commission via an SRP is X% based on any license structure (except for cloud costs regarding a Weaviate Cluster Platform (WCP) i.e., Weaviate’s managed service.) or lump sum price for e.g. training and certification.
- A SRP may offer secondary training to Weaviate.
- A SRP may not offer secondary certification to Weaviate.
- A sales commission in the territory and branch of an SRP through another referral is 40% of X based on any license structure (except for cloud costs regarding a Weaviate Cluster Platform (WCP) i.e., Weaviate’s managed service.) or lump sum price for e.g. training and certification.
- A sales commission in the territory and branch of _another_ SRP through another referral is 60% of X based on any license structure (except for cloud costs regarding a Weaviate Cluster Platform (WCP) i.e., Weaviate’s managed service.) or lump sum price for e.g. training and certification.
- Weaviate pricing is determined by SeMI.

Example calculation

| Region | Situation | Commision SRP-A | Commision SRP-B |
| ------ | --------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Germany | SRP-A sells in own industry | 100% of X | 0% of X |
| Germany | SRP-A sells in an industry owned by SRP-B | 60% of X | 40% of X |
| Germany | SRP-B sells in an unclaimed industry | 0% of X | 100% of X |
