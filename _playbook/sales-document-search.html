            <b>Challenge: </b> Many companies use unstructured documents to store text. From PDFs to Word documents and from website input fields to emails. The current problem is that data only can be retrieved by searching for keywords rather than the context in which the data is represented. For example, when searching for "science fiction" in a traditional book search engine, you might find anything related to "science" or "fiction" so this would include "neuro<b>science</b>" but not "a book about the future".
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Solution: </b> Weaviate indexes data from any source based on its meaning. This is achieved by leveraging machine learning models that index text in a space, similar documents are placed close to similar concepts and words which allows the end-user to easily find the documents.

            <b>Integrates with: </b> Weaviate's API integrates with any API-based platform and application. The Weaviate Console can also be used to visualize search through the documents.
