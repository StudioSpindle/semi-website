# Contextionary

This is a combination of natural-language based AI tools that takes all the data in your Weaviate and interprets context and meaning. This means that if you have the word “Apple” in the data of your electronics store Weaviate understands it to be the company and not the fruit. Words are given context, so it is clear what is meant. This transforms your raw data into powerful knowledge which can be queried in immensely complex ways with simple natural language.

Contextualized data has multiple use cases from a single data set. Weaviate has a built-in Contextionary which has been trained, on vast numbers of public data sources including Wikipedia, to interpret your data and to give it context. If needed we can create custom Contextionaries for businesses or domains with specific complex syntax like law, medicine and engineering.

The Contextionary is in constant development and will be enhanced over time. New features will always become available to all customers without extra cost.
