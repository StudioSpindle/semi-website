## Data Usage

Regardless if you are an airliner, financial institution or a farmer, one of your most valuable assets is stored in the form of digital data. And if you are as most companies, simply sharing or even selling the data is something you can't do because your customer's privacy or because of the data containing insights that make your business unique and you wouldn't want it to fall in the hands of your competitors. And even if you wanted to do this, harmonizing data sources is extremely complex.

But on the other hand, you know that you have valuable information, information that could benefit others without you violating any of your principles or endangering your business.

At SeMI, we believe that the solution to both the problem and opportunity lies in the meta-data of your original system of record data.

Let's take the following example;

The airliner above has very sensitive information, but actually knowing that it was John Doe that both the hot dog isn't really interesting. It is valuable to know that people who fly to Madrid actually want hot dogs!

> It is all about meta-data!

### Decentralized Network

The SeMI network connects all these sets of information without actually harvesting it to a centralized platform. That means you are in complete control over how the original data is handled and how it is stored.

If we bring the meta-data of a multitude of companies to a large network, we can all benefit from each other's insights without giving away the actual data!

## You are in control of your information

SeMI is a [decentralized](/nomenclature/#dn) [knowledge network](/nomenclature/#kn), which means that each member of the SeMI network deploys SeMI from their own systems: there is no central SeMI central data storage. Effectively each member has its own data vault on their own systems, which can only be accessed through an [API](/nomenclature/#api). So you are in complete control of the safety of your data.

The raw data itself is never shared or made available.  The API returns only the "answer" to a question - not the data that makes up the answer. The data itself stays safe in the data vault, while the answer is exposed through the API. 

We understand that your information sources may contain information about individuals, otherwise known as “personal data”. With the recent development of legislation it is important to manage the information that you share with other participants of the network. 

We have several tools to help you. In our on-boarding workshops, for example, we help you define your ontology (see our [on-boarding primer](/knowledge-base/start/onboarding-brief/)). This ontology is an important mechanism in refining your data into knowledge graphs using our SeMI tool and our knowledge base. This refining process makes it highly impractical to connect personal data to an identifiable person.
