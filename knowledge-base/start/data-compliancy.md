## You are in control of your information

SeMI is a decentralized knowledge network, which means that each member of the SeMI network deploys SeMI from their own systems:  there is no central SeMI central data storage.  Effectively each member has its own data vault on their own systems, which can only be accessed through an API. So you are in complete control of the safety of your data.

The raw data itself is never shared or made available.  The API returns only the "answer" to a question - not the data that makes up the answer. The data itself stays safe in the data vault, while the answer is exposed through the API. 

We understand that your information sources may contain information about individuals, otherwise known as “personal data”. With the recent development of legislation it is important to manage the information that you share with other participants of the network. 

We have several tools to help you. In our on-boarding workshops, for example, we help you define your ontology (see our [on-boarding primer](/knowledge-base/start/onboarding-brief.html)). This ontology is an important mechanism in refining your data into knowledge graphs using our SeMI tool and our knowledge base. This refining process makes it highly impractical to connect personal data to an identifiable person.
