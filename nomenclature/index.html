			<dt id="api">Application programming interface (API</dt>
			<dd>
				<p> In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.<br>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">read more</a>]</p>

    			<dd>
    		   		 <p>Decentralized [networking] is the allocation of resources, both hardware and software, to each individual workstation, or office location. In contrast, centralized computing exists when the majority of functions are carried out, or obtained from a remote centralized location. Decentralized computing is a trend in modern-day business environments. This is the opposite of centralized computing, which was prevalent during the early days of computers.<br>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_computing">read more</a>]</p>
