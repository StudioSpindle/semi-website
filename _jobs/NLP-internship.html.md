## About SeMI Technologies

At SeMI technologies we are all about knowledge. With our open-source search graph [Weaviate](/products/weaviate/), we work at the forefront of data and knowledge representation. With a state of the art language model at the core of our product, we put modern NLP into practice.

We enable our customers and open source community users to understand their data and drive business decisions using an AI-first approach.

## What We Are Looking For

We are looking for bachelor/master students who are motivated to learn and grow. Projects are based on the applicant's profile and interests, and we are more than open to mentor a project on new ideas and initiatives.
We offer both regular internships and bachelor/master thesis projects.
Applicants must have experience with programming and be comfortable with speaking English. Some of the following additional skills may be helpful:

1. Collaborative development (Git)
2. Python, Javascript or Go
3. Machine learning

## What You Will Be Working On

Our software relies heavily on state-of-the-art work in machine learning and natural language processing. You will be focussing on doing experiments (with the team and independent) and planning of implementations to improve Weaviate, propose new features, and investigate opportunities.

## How We Work

We believe in autonomy, creativity, and flexibility. Our [international team](/about/) lives these values by working closely together in a decentralized (i.e., remote) manner, and all team members are given agency over their own projects.

## Learn While You Work

We offer the opportunity to gain insights into the development of modern data products including cloud computing, data analysis, machine learning, front-end, and back-end programming.
