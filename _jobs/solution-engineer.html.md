## About SeMI Technologies

At SeMI technologies we are all about knowledge. With our open-source search graph [Weaviate](/products/weaviate/), we work at the forefront of data and knowledge representation. With a state of the art language model at the core of our product, we put modern NLP into practice.

We enable our customers and open source community users to understand their data and drive business decisions using an AI-first approach.

## What We Are Looking For

We are looking for engineers who are able to work independently, take ownership of a topic and are motivated to lead, learn and grow. Applicants must have significant programming experience and be comfortable communicating in English. Experience with Python, Javascript / HTML, and with collaborative development such as Git, are a plus for this role.

## What You Will Be Working On

The work of a solution engineer is twofold:

1. Support our customers with their application and frontend development on Weaviate.
2. Take ownership of the tools built around Weaviate, such as for example the Weaviate Console.

## How We Work

We believe in autonomy, creativity, and flexibility. Our [international team](/about/) lives these values by working closely together in a decentralized (i.e., remote) manner, and all team members are given agency over their own projects.

## Learn While You Work

We offer the opportunity to gain insights into the development of modern data products including cloud computing, data analysis, machine learning, front-end, and back-end programming.
