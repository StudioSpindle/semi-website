## About SeMI Technologies

At SeMI technologies we are all about knowledge. With our open-source vector search engine [Weaviate](/solutions/weaviate/), we work at the forefront of data and knowledge representation. With a state of the art language model at the core of our product, we put modern NLP into practice.

We enable our customers and open source community users to understand their data and drive business decisions using an AI-first approach.
