## Introduction 

This service level agreement (‘SLA’) describes the levels of service that [company name] (‘the client) will receive from SeMI Technologies B.V.. (‘Vendor’). 

This SLA should be read alongside the terms of use (https://semi.technoloy/terms) between the client and Vendor. Although the SLA covers key areas of the client’s provided services and support, other contracts may include areas not covered by this SLA. 

## Purpose 

The client’s received service depends on IT software and services (together: ‘the System’) that are provided, maintained and supported by Vendor. Some of these items are of critical importance to the business. This service level agreement sets out what levels of availability and support the client is guaranteed to receive the System. It also explains what penalties will be applied to Vendor should it fail to meet these levels. This SLA forms an important part of the contract between the client and Vendor. It aims to enable the two parties to work together effectively. 

## Dates and reviews 

This agreement begins on [date] and will run for a period of [number] months. It may be reviewed at any point, by mutual agreement. It may also be reviewed if there are any changes to the client’s needs or uses. 

## Services covered 

This SLA covers only those services provided by Vendor to the client for the purpose of data analysis. Vendor provides Weaviate - a vector search engine. This SLA contemplates only those above-named services and makes no guarantees or representations as to the provision or availability of any other service that may be provided by Vendor as an ancillary benefit to its clients. 

Exclusions 
This SLA is written in good faith. Vendor will always do everything possible to rectify every issue in a timely manner. However, there are exclusions. This SLA does not apply to: 

- Any equipment, software, services, third party or otherwise, or any other parts of the System not listed above. 
- Software, equipment or services not purchased via and managed by Vendor. 

Additionally, this SLA does not apply when: 

- The problem has been caused by using equipment, software or service(s) in a way that is not recommended. 
- The client has made unauthorized changes to the configuration or set up of affected equipment, software or services. 
- The client has prevented Vendor from performing required maintenance and update tasks. 
- The issue has been caused by unsupported mobile devices, equipment, software or other services. 

This SLA does not apply in circumstances that could be reasonably said to be beyond Vendor’s control. For instance: floods, war, acts of god, civil unrest and so on. This SLA also does not apply if the client is in breach of its contract with Vendor for any reason (e.g. late payment of fees, improper use, violation of terms, etc.).
