    	<h2>How SeMI creates value</h2>
    	<p>SeMI provides companies direct access to the relevant data they need – in real time.</p>
    	<p>SeMI is a knowledge network, where members can exchange metadata.  As a member, you receive customized and real time insights, which are unavailable elsewhere. For additional insights, you can build your own application on top of SeMI.</p>

    	<h2>Make sense of your data</h2>
    	<p>SeMI uses natural language processing to help you make sense of your data. SeMI is a decentralized semantic knowledge network.</p>
    	<p>By exchanging metadata with others in the network, you can enrich your insights about your customers and market. SeMI focuses on the things that the raw data portrays and links that information together to create a knowledge graph.</p>
    	<p>The power of SeMI is its ability to connect multiple systems and sources of information without a common information structure. Different systems and sources do not need to know about each other’s dataset and the way that the information is stored. Everyone’s data is secured.</p>
