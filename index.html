    	<h2>Can you make sense of your data?</h2>
		<p>Let’s admit it&#8201;–&#8201;If your company is like most, you are having difficulty gaining information and insights from your data. At SeMI, we believe natural language processing can give meaning and context to your data.</p>
		<p>SeMI is a decentralized network, where members can exchange knowledge based on the insights hidden in their metadata. As a member you can receive customized and real time insights. To magnify the value you can build your own application on top of SeMI.</p>
