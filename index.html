    	<h2>Can you make sense of your data?</h2>
		<p>Let’s admit it&#8201;–&#8201;If your company is like most, you are having difficulty gaining information and insights from your data. At SeMI, we believe <a href="/nomenclature.html#nlp">natural language processing</a> can give meaning and context to your data.</p>
		<p>SeMI is a decentralized network, where members can exchange knowledge based on the insights hidden in their metadata. SeMI is a unique network, where you as a member can receive customized and real time insights, which are unavailable elsewhere. For additional insights, you can even build your own application on top of SeMI.</p>

        	<p>SeMI uses <em>natural language processing</em> to help you <em>make sense of your data</em> in a way that <em>makes sense to you</em>. Natural language processing focuses on the <em>interactions between human language and computers</em>.</p>

        	<p>SeMI is a <em>decentralized semantic</em> knowledge network, where members <em>exchange knowledge</em> based on metadata. This enables you to <em>exponentially enrich your insights</em> about your customers and market. SeMI focuses on the things that the raw data portrays and links that information together to create a knowledge graph.</p>

        	<p>The power of SeMI is its ability to <em>connect multiple systems and sources of information</em> without a common information structure. Different systems and sources do not need to know about each other’s dataset and the way that the information is stored. <em>Everyone’s data is secured</em>.</p>
