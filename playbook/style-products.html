        <section class="style-sm-section">
                    <p>These are the major and minor offerings on the SeMI Weaviate roster. Each performs a  different function and a customer will always have at least one core product and optionally others of both types</p>
<h3>Core products</h3>
<p>These are the Weaviate software itself in three different flavors, this is the heart of any Weaviate instance.</p>

<h3>Add ons</h3>
<p>These are existing supplementary tools that can be added onto a Weaviate instance to either expand functionality or improve performance. Some, like consulting, are potentially useful to all customers and others like Keyper are only relevant in specific installations. For example a banking Weaviate would only need Keyper if it contained multiple search graphs. Add ons are generic enhancements which are useful to many different Weaviate installations.</p>

<h3>Point solutions</h3>
<p>These are unique industry or topic-focused tools that are available to solve specific issues. A user will only want these in specific circumstances. For example the Common Knowledge Point solution is only useful where the Weaviate contains a large amount of general data which needs to be understood. A Weaviate containing banking data would not need the Common Knowledge point solution but after discussion with consultants we could build a banking terminology point solution.</p>
