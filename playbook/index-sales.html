    <h1>SeMI's Sales Playbook</h1>
    <p>
      SeMI's core solution is Weaviate which is publically available as an open-source project. At SeMI we sell upgrades of
      the open-source license (from startups to enterprise-grade), additional product support, and we have a cloud offering.
      Together with <a href="./index-partnerships.html">our partners</a>, we bring these products and services to the market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because Weaviate can be used for a wide variety of solutions, we have created an evergrowing set of <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/a/58854/155879">sales plays</a> that can
      be used to target potential customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case you have questions about the sales plays or if you have any suggestions, make sure to <a href="mailto:hello@semi.technology">let us know</a>.

        allows for the creation of more customer-specific solution. The guides below guide you through Weaviate's capabilities
        aiming to spark your imagination on how it can be applied with customers in more ways than outlined above.
