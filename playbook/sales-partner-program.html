        <h1>Sales Partner Program</h1>
        
        <p>
            The SeMI Sales Partnership program has three tiers of which a partner can choose one;

            <ol class="style-sm-overview">
                <li>Warm referral partnership.</li>
                <li>Direct sales partnership.</li>
                <li>Recurring sales partnership.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            All partners have access to the Refer a Referral program.

            For all three tiers the following rules are applied;

            <ol class="style-sm-overview">
                <li>The referred potential customer should be a contact that is unknown to SeMI.</li>
                <li>A referral is always an individual inside a company, not a company itself.</li>
                <li>An individual within a prospect company is always owned by one sales partner.</li>
                <li>Multiple sales partners can work with the same prospect companies.</li>
                <li>After each introduction meeting, a confirmation email will be sent to determine the type of referral.</li>
                <li>Access to Slack and WhatsApp groups.</li>
                <li>A partner’s name and contact details to be added to our website and communication channels.</li>
                <li>Partnership contracts are reviewed by two SeMI directors and confirmed via DocuSign.</li>
                <li>A partnership starts when the partnership contract is signed.</li>
                <li>SeMI is responsible for providing information to construct a use case, this information will always be delivered through the website.</li>
                <li>A sales partner is responsible for defining the case.</li>
                <li>SeMI branded logos, slide decks, etcetera will be made available to the sales partner.</li>
                <li>All deals are per use case.</li>
                <li>Partnerships will be reviewed every 6 months.</li>
                <li>A sales partner introduction that leads to a SeMI partnership is not part of the agreement.</li>
            </ol>          
        </p>

        <h2>Warm Referral Partnership</h2>

        <p>
            A direct sales partner (DSP) is similar to the warm referral partnership (WRP) but with the distinction that a DSP stays part of the sales process until a signed contract.
        
            <ol class="style-sm-overview">
                <li>A deal should be closed within 6 months after the introduction.</li>
                <li>If the company referral refers to other people in the organization, this shouldn't be more than 3 internal referrals.</li>
                <li>A referral always needs to be warm. I.e.;</li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
                <li>A WRP commission is a percentage of the first invoice.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h2>Direct Sales Partnership</h2>
        </p>

        <p>A direct sales partner (DSP) is similar to the warm referral partnership (WRP) but with the distinction that a DSP stays part of the sales process until a signed contract.</p>

        <p>
            <h2>Recurring Sales Partnership</h2>
        </p>
        <p>A recurring sales partner (RSP) is similar to the direct sales partnership, with the difference that the RSP’s commission is based on recurring revenue.</p>

        <p>
            <h2>Refer a Referral</h2>
        </p>

        <p>The refer a referral (RaR) program is available to every partner who introduces SeMI to a new sales partner, regardless of the tier, will receive a bonus percentage when this new partner conducts a sale.</p>
