        <h1>Sales Play: Solution Search for E-commerce</h1>
        
        <p>
            <b>Challenge: </b>When selling solutions online, search is the goto functionality customers use to find the solutions they are looking for
            but in <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/state-ecommerce-search/">83% of the cases</a>, customers can't find what they are looking for which might result in customers going to
            competitors to find the solution they are looking for. Search engines are often lacking the capabilities to tackle the
            last 17% of searches because people are looking for conceptual keywords (e.g., vegetables for soup) that only can be
            found if data is available to make these links.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Solution: </b>SeMI's Weaviate is a <i>semantic</i> search engine. Besides having almost all the features traditional search engines
            have, it has the capabilities to understand relations thanks to its build-in machine learning model "the Contextionary"
            (learn more about it in the in-depth sales play about semantic search). Weaviate can automatically make relations
            between categories (e.g., "fruits") and solutions (e.g., "strawberries") or context (e.g., "a former politician") and
            solutions (e.g., "Terminator 2").
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Integrates with: </b>Any well-known e-commerce platform (e.g., <a href="https://magento.com/">Magento</a>, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/">Big Commerce</a>, <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/">Prestashop</a>, and many others) or a custom build
            e-commerce solution.
