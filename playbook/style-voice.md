# Voice and Tone

First of all: Keep it brief - we are all short of time - try to compress your words to a level where they are still clear. It takes a little time but it is worth it. 

Blaise Pascale probably said it first (in 1657):
> I have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter.  

There are a lot of style guides in the world and if you have ever done some writing you have probably used them. If you are an experienced writer you don’t need the majority of the advice, if you are new it is pretty handy.
Here are some well-constructed guides

* [Mailchimp](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/voice-and-tone/)
*	[A list apart](https://alistapart.com/about/style-guide)
*	[Gather content](https://gathercontent.com/blog/voice-tone-style-whys-wheres-hows)

And it is worth reading the below for a different perspective
*	[Medium](https://medium.com/@JJFoxBox/you-dont-need-a-voice-tone-style-guide-53e9a11f3d36)

If you are an experienced writer you don’t need the guide, you need the more technical part and the glossary for standardization. 

## Best practices for SeMI documents

Whatever your level of writing skill keep these things in mind:
*	Excellent: we do our best
*	Concise: we don’t waste the reader’s time
*	Clear: we don’t hide behind long polysyllabic words and flowery language
*	Active: we use phrases like “load the file” and do not use “the file should be loaded”
*	Consistent: we use the same voice and elements to build trust and ease reading
*	Dynamic: our writing flows and is not dull
*	Progressive: everything can be improved, there is always a next version that is better
*	Diverse: inclusive, global, thoughtful, considerate

**These points represent us – we use them  in our writing to show the personality of SeMI**


## Voices
We have 2 voices which are named after their audience.
- Voice 1: _Contributor_ Programmers and other technical people
- Voice 2: _User_ Business people, probably non-technical

Our ideal is that no technical language gets into the User documents. If it does you will need to explain the technical terms.
