    <h1>Software Engineering: Development &amp; Architecture at SeMI</h1>
    <p>
      Our paradigms for software development is based on a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2057045/pythons-os-makedirs-doesnt-understand-in-my-path" target="_blank">quality-first approach</a> with a strong focus on
      user experience (UX) and development experience (DX). Most of the times we follow a
      cloud-first approach, making sure our software is resilient and scalable.

    <h2 id="quality">Development Quality Standards</h2>
    <h3>A Focus on Testing</h3>
    <p>
      At SeMI, we believe that testing is a powerful way to help us move forward faster while maintaining quality.
      We like tests for three main capabilities;
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Acceptance: Don't develop too much</strong><br />A green test can indicate that your
        feature is complete and you can stop development. It is also a contract that indicates the
        feature actually works as it should.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prevent Regressions</strong><br />&quot;This can't be broken, I just fixed this, who
        broke it again?&quot; Heard something like this before? We believe every bugfix should
        introduce a new test. As long as this test stays green it's impossible to reintroduce the
        bug accidentally.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Piece of mind when Refactoring</strong><br />
        In production software, requirements change and code is rarely perfect from the get-go.
        A green test suite provides us with the confidence that a new or improved feature is done and that our users should not worry about problems introduced after updating the software.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Considering that extending an existing code base takes much more time than writing something new from scratch,
      the three capabilities of tests above will save you hours of development hours over time.
    </p>

    <h3>Test-Driven Development</h3>
    <p>
      With Test-Driven Development (TDD), you write the test first and then start your actual
      development to make the tests pass. Once it's green, you are aren't allowed to add any more
      logic to it. However, ("Red-Green-Refactor") now is a great time to safely refactor your code.
      TDD is an amazing tool to help you achieve two goals: First of all, it makes sure you actually
      write useful tests because you aren't allowed to write any code if it's not meant to make an
      exisiting test green. Furthermore, you make sure that you write the minimal code needed to
      achieve the feature. TDD therefore also prevents
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it" target="_blank">YAGNI situations</a>.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
      We want to be pragmatic though, we know that TDD can be quite daunting at first, especially
      for new developers. We encourage everyone to aim to do TDD most of the timed and we will
      certainly help you get there, but we understand if you can't go 100% TDD from day one.
    </p> -->

    <h3 id="test-pyramid">The Test Pyramid</h3>
    <p>
      The
      <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html#TheTestPyramid" target="_blank">
        test pyramid
      </a>
      is a great tool to make sure that tests which are expensive to write, run and extend are rare.
      Tests which are easy and fast to write and execute tests should be plentyful. Integration
      tests help to safely cross application boundaries, such as a db connection. Contract tests
      prevent breakage of unsuspecting consumers.
    </p>

    <h3>Mockist vs Classical Testing</h3>
    <p>
      A good rule of thumb is to always test the public interface of a method, function or class. We
      want our test to ensure the user-facing behavior, not to force a specific implementation. In
      the debate of
      <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html#ClassicalAndMockistTesting" target="_blank">
        Classic vs Mockist Tests
      </a>
      , we tend to sit on the classicists' side. We believe mocks (or stubs or similiar stand-ins)
      are a great choice when a unit test would otherwise turn into a (much slower) integration
      test, but we want to avoid testing (too many) internals or hiding logic through mocks. As with
      most things a healthy dose of pragmatism should help you choose.
    </p>

    <h3>Clean Code</h3>
    <p>
      Our coding style is strongly influenced by <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/" target="_blank">Uncle Bob's Clean Code</a>,
      a book we recommend for every developer to read.
      We don't view the topics raised in the book as hard rules, but as helpful suggestions to clean up our code.
    </p>

    <h3>Application-level Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      "Architecture" is one of those words that can have different meanings on different levels.
      Within SeMI, we are distinguishing between system-level architecture and application-level architecture.
      The latter mostly means "how a single application is strucured internally". This depends on every application and every
      use case and it is important to keep the individual dev teams' autonomy. One application
      stands out, though: Weaviate, as it has a very central role. There we chose to structure our
      code in accordance with
      <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html" target="_blank">
        Clean Architecture
      </a>
      , a set of guidelines that fits the requirements of Weaviate really well and helped clean up
      the code base considerably.
    </p>

    <h2 id="cloud-native">Cloud Native &amp; and 12-factor compatible applications</h2>
    <h3>Development for the cloud</h3>
    <p>
      Many of the applcations we build are intended to be highly resilient, highly scalable and
      continously updated. It is thus not surprising, that our developers keep a cloud-native
      mindset when starting to write the first lines of code.
    </p>
    <h3>At SeMI we love Docker &amp; Kubernetes</h3>
    <p>
      Docker and Kubernetes are the two tools to appear in the last decade that have changed the
      industry the most. Many are struggling, because the shift of mindset is so large for some. But
      at SeMI, we use both to make our lives easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Docker</strong> is a first-class citizen in our development process. Gone are the days
      were local development took days to setup to get developers started. Gone are the days where a
      developer's machine needed to be precisly set up so it could run the applications. Docker
      offers the perfect balance of virtualization: Considerably faster, smaller and more
      lightweight than a VM, but with all the isolation capabilites we need for reproducible
      development.
    </p>
    <p>
      In accordance with <a href="#12-factor">12-factor principles</a>, we don't ever compile our
      application for a specific environment, there is just one appliation and environments are just
      sets of configuration. Using Docker helps us achieve this.
    </p>
    <p>
      With docker-compose we can run our entire application stack - even if it has the most obscure
      backing dependencies - locally. And not just that, but it is very, very similar to an actual
      production environment, too. Additionally, we can comfortably run
      <a href="#test-pyramid">integration and end2end</a> tests with containerized backing
      databases.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our runtimes, we bet on <strong>Kubernetes</strong>, because we see Kubernetes as the
      logical extension of Docker. Docker is really good for isolation and delievering
      production-quality artifacts as a a result of our development process. But - even with
      docker-compose - it lacks the capabilites to run application at actual production quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kubernetes provides our runtime environments with many elements completely for free that would
      be very costly to implement otherwise: rolling updates, service discovery, (automatic) scaling
      for HA applications and so much more.
    </p>
    <p>This is why we love Docker &amp; Kubernetes at SeMI.</p>

    <h3 id="12-factor">A 12-factor mindset</h3>
    <p>
      When an application is intended for the cloud, we have already established that we get a lot
      of - otherwise costly - features for free from Docker &amp; Kubernetes. However, there is a
      cost: While you can technically dockerize and deploy any application, you lose out on most
      benefits if your application does not take the specialities of the cloud environment into
      consideration from the get-go. This is why all applications intended for scalable deployment -
      such as Weaviate - must adhere to <a href="https://12factor.net/" target="_blank">12-factor principles</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      While all of them are important, we still want to focus on three in particular: Config (#3),
      Processes (#6) and Disposability (#9). If you take these into account, you'll end up with a
      stateless application which can automatically be scaled up and down on demand and is in no way
      specific to a particular environment. And we think that's a pretty cool thing. And of course a
      requirement to make use of what makes Kubernetes great.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
      Sound daunting? Don't worry! If building for the cloud is new to you, it can be a bit
      overwhelming to take in 12 new guidelines at once. We know that feeling. Once you've joined
      SeMI, we'll help you get there.
    </p> -->

    <h2 id="devops">Dev vs. Ops vs. DevOps</h2>
    <h3>You build, you run it</h3>
    <p>
      We like the principle of "you build it, you run it". It takes a more complete approach to
      development, because it accepts that running an application is part of the development
      process. And debugging software that you wrote yourself in production is considerably easier
      than having someone else do it for you.
    </p>
    <h3>The difference between a solution and an (open source) product</h3>
    <!-- <h3>Running a webshop vs. building an open-source product</h3> -->
    <!-- <p>
      However, we must also accept the fact, that at SeMI our development &amp; operations situation
      is sometimes a bit different from other companies. Let's say you were part of a company that
      runs an e-commerce solution, like an online web shop for buying groceries. Your team might own
      one specific part of that solution, such as the search feature. As part of that team you would
      own this feature end-to-end from development through testing &amp; QA all the way to
      production. If the search for a shop is down, the business obviosuly loses money. So, a large
      part of the development team's responsibility is to make sure the search stays available.
      Since developers can't take care of that 24/7, an SRE-approach is often used to combine the
      operations ownership that a DevOps strategy contains with 24/7 support capabilities.
    </p> -->

    <!-- <p>
      At SeMI we believe in the exact same principles, but we must also accept that our situation is
      a bit different: We don't build a service that is then scaled to a very large user base.
      Instead we build an open-source product, that can then be idendepently deployed many times
      over. For example, a customer might want to deploy Weaviate on premise. Another customer might
      want us to host Weaviate for them. Someone using the free version of weaviate might simply
      download a docker image and run it for themselves.
    </p> -->
    <p>
      At SeMI, we don't build a one-off service but we build an open-source product, that can then be idendepently deployed many times
      over. For example, a customer might want to deploy Weaviate on premise. Another customer might
      want us to host Weaviate for them. Someone using the free version of weaviate might simply
      download a docker image and run it for themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      A pure "You build it, you run it" approach, is therefore impossible at SeMI. There could be
      thousands of Weaviate instances deployed and not every developer might be aware of them. This
      is why we need some sort of a "Dev" and "Ops" split. Nevertheless, we want to incorporate
      DevOps principles as closely into our culture as possible:
    </p>

    <h3>A DevOps middleground at SeMI</h3>
    <p>
      Even when it's impossible for every developer to know about every single deployment, it is
      still in the responsibility of our developers to keep the path to production as clear and as
      fast as possible. Our releases are still continously deployed to a production-like
      environment. Developers still need to think about how to mitigate breaking changes.
      Development still only finishes when a feature is successfully deployed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Operations is then simply a matter of multiplying the artifacts from our DevOps process for
      our clients.
    </p>

    <h3>Infra as Code</h3>
    <p>
      When we deploy for our clients or for ourselves, we always treat our
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code" target="_blank">Infrastcture as Code</a>. This
      way, our infrastcture is easily scalable, disposable and reproducible. Especially managing a
      large set of customer deployments, we can easily automate common tasks and processes in a safe
      and reproducible way. We like to use Terraform to manage cloud infrastructure and Helm to
      manage Kubernetes deployments. Using a GitOps approach, we commit changes into version control
      and let a build pipeline execute them. We never manually configure infrastructure. This helps
      us to change live environments with confidence, test environments before breaking production
      and provides an audit log for free.
    </p>

    <h2 id="organizing">Organizing &amp; Managing our work</h2>

    <h3>What Agile means for us</h3>
    <p>
      These days, "agile" has often become synomous with following a Scrum or Kanban routine. Many
      organizations schedule a daily stand-up and bi-weekly ceremonies and think that makes them
      agile. We believe in agility in the truest sense: This means, we have very small, but complete
      features in tiny iterations. This way we can get feedback from real users very fast. How we
      get there and what kind of rituals were involved is secondary. So don't be surprised if you're
      encountering way fewer meetings than you would in other agile companies - most of them agile
      in name only.
    </p>

    <h3>Frequent Releases tagged with Semantic Versioning</h3>
    <p>
      We always aim to make releases as frequent as possible. Sometimes this leads to tiny releases
      that have only a small noticable effect to the user. This is good. Those tiny changes really
      add up over time and a product develops.
      <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">Semantic Versioning</a> helps conveying the severity of a change
      at a glance. The high frequency of releases helps us to gather important feedback quickly.
      Sometimes the feedback for a specific release immediately affects the following release.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no set frequency for releases. We release as soon as something is complete and
      provides value to the user. To make sure we never lose this user focus, we aim to write
      high-quality changelogs. This help users to see why they should upgrade and what happens if
      they do so. It also helps us to think about what is release-worthy and what isn't. For some
      examples on changelos check out the
      <a href="https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate/releases" target="_blank">Weaviate Realeases Page</a>
      or the
      <a href="https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate-helm/releases" target="_blank">
        Weaviate Helm Chart Releases Page
      </a>
      .
    </p>

    <h3>GitHub Issues to manage chunks of work</h3>
    <p>
      A large focus on our everyday work is on open-source work. Therefore using GitHub to manage
      our work comes absolutely naturally. In fact, we love this approach so much, that we are also
      using it, if we develop something that cannot be open-sourced.
    </p>
    <p>
      A unit of work corresponds to a GitHub issue. This issue is the standard format that everyone
      at SeMI understands. If features depend on one another, issues can easily be referenced from
      other issues, commits or anything that accepts a hyperlink. When a unit of work should be
      split up further to manage your daily routines, a simple task list inside the first post of an
      issue is a great way to do this. However, everyone has their personal preferences. The
      important thing is that finishing the overall unit of work can be indicated by closing the
      GitHub issue.
    </p>

    <h3>Transperancy &amp; Progress Updates</h3>
    <blockquote>
      The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time.
      The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time
      (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-ninety_rule" target="_blank">Source</a>)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      We know that estimations are hard. And we think it's nearly impossible to do an exact
      estimation. But we believe every developer should make sure they are building the smallest
      possible artifact to deliver. Additionally developers should be good at communicating progress
      or potentials obstacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      We think it makes a lot of sense - when picking up new work - to spend some time on breaking
      it down into even smaller chunks of work. Simply ticking of those TODOs that were planned up
      front are already a great status indicator. Nevertheless one of the greatest skills for a
      developer to have is to be vocal when something doesn't go as planned. We are all in the same
      boat and always willing to help if you are stuck somewhere.
    </p>

    <h3>Working with Git: Commiting your work</h3>
    <p>
      We believe in the value of proper git commit messages. This means a commit message should
      contain a reference to the issue that lead to the development. Additionally the message should
      describe what you did in
      <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3580764" target="_blank">present, imperative tense</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body of a commit message is a great place to convey intent: Why are things they way the
      are. What shold someone immediately know when they look at this commit a year from now? It can
      sometimes be really helpful if you are looking at a specific piece of code and wondering why
      things are the way the are. A simple <code>git blame</code> leads you to the original commit
      message. If this message contains a short paragrahp that answers the why, it was a really good
      commit message.
    </p>
    <h3>Git branching strategies</h3>
    <p>
      We are inspired by Cloud-Native and Continous Deployment process. Additionally, we like to
      keep things simple. That's why we prefer
      <a href="http://kean.github.io/post/trunk-based-development" target="_blank">trunk-based development</a> over
      more complex git branching strategies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the open-source nature of many of our codebases and the potential for outside
      contributions, we think Pull Requests are a great tool to submit your work to the trunk.
      Whether a PR-based approach like this is still trunk-based development in its most literal
      sense is debatable. However, for us the important thing is that there are no long-lived
      branches. By keeping features small, we also keep the branches to base PRs off short-lived.
      This prevents merge-hell, leads to frequent and confident releases and very short feedback
      cycles.
