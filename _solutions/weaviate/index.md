            Weaviate's semantic search features can be integrated into any website or app and help you find better results-based on its build-in semantic machine learning model. Where traditional search engines only find keywords, Weaviate is able to understand the context of the question and your data to provide users with better results while searching.

        <p>
            From PDFs to emails, almost 80% of data is stored in documents and most search engines only allow you to find insights based on keywords. Weaviate is able to index your documents based on context which helps you to find more relevant information even if the documents don't contain the keywords from your query.
