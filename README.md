# SeMI-Website ![Travis Build](https://travis-ci.org/SeMI-network/semi-website.svg?branch=master "Logo Travis Build")

Dependencies:
- [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

Make sure both (Bundler and npm) are installed on your system before you proceed. For more information on how to install check above links.

## :rocket: Deployment

Google cloud sdk with nginx is used for production.

## :construction: Local development

### Using docker

If you only care about running the website quickly to verify your changes look
good before deployment, you can use the supplied Dockerfile. Simply run

```
docker build -t semi-website . && docker run -p 4000:4000 semi-website
```

from the root. You can then access the site at localhost:4000. By default there
is no live-reloading included. If you make changes you have to rebuild (and
run) the container. The layer caching is quite optimized though, so rebuilding
should be quite fast.

You can also mount specific directories as volumes to enable live reloading.
For example to add live reloading to the documentation (located in the
`_documentation` subfolder), simply run

```
docker run -p 4000:4000 -v "$(pwd)/_documentation:/website/_documentation" semi-website
```
You can add multiple volumes like this, if you require other folders as well.

**Warning**: The docker image above is only meant for aiding with devleopment,
it uses `jekyll serve` and is therefore not suited for production use.

### Running everything locally

Alternatively, if you need full control over all resources, you can also setup
your local environment as described here.

To start a project first install Bundler as described [in the Bundler documentation](https://bundler.io/).

To install the dependencies (used for jekyll page generation) run:

```bash
$ bundle install
$ npm install
```

To build the **local development** website:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

Build and watch the website

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Documentation

- menu structure is set in `./config.yml`.

# Tests

Run eslint and prettier to see code formatting errors

```bash
$ npm run eslint
$ npm run prettier
```

Test the links

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll build
$ bundle exec rake test
```

To rewrite prettier errors automatically run:

```bash
$ prettier --write ./js-src/modules/**
```
