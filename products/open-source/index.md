# Weaviate Open Source

## The Decentralized Knowledge Graph

The Open Source version of Weavciate consists of our powerful knowledge graph software in GitHub. You can use the supplied Contextionary (which we continuously upgrade so your experience improves). You can use your own team to work with the software and start deploying use cases right away. You can create a peer-to-peer network of multiple weaviates. The online playground is also there for data analysis.
