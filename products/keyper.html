                    <p>One of the most powerful features of Weaviate is the ability to connect multiple weaviates together in a <a href="/products/networking.html">network</a>.</p> <p>Keyper is used to set up and maintain the network of weaviate peers. It makes it possible for the peers to communicate with each other and to ensure that each peer has a known state e.g. "peer is available", "new peer added" or "peer removed".</p><p> Keyper will also communicate changes like "peer data updated" which would trigger a refresh at the other peers so they were all using the most current data. </p>
