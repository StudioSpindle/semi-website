                <p>The Open Source version of Weaviate consists of our powerful knowledge graph software in GitHub. You can use the supplied Contextionary (which we continuously upgrade so your experience improves). You can use your own team to work with the software and start deploying use cases right away. You can create a peer-to-peer network of multiple weaviates. The online playground is also there for data analysis.</p>

                <p>Weaviate's Playground is a graphical user interface that enables you to gather insights from the knowledge graph directly. Users of Weaviate Open Source can use the Playground on their websites, and Weaviate Enterprise users receive a custom version they can run wherever they want.</p>
