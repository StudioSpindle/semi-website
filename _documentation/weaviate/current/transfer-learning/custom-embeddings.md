## Basics

- [Transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning) allows you to extend Weaviate in real-time.
- A `POST` request to the RESTful endpoint `/c11y/extensions` is for extending the contextionary with custom concepts.
- a `GET` request to the RESTful endpoint `/c11y/concepts/{}` returns if a concept is part of the Contextionary. 
- Learn more about creating a custom contextionary [here](../more-resources/FAQ.html#q-can-i-train-my-own-contextionary).

## Introduction

If you have a use case which contains particular words or abbreviations that Weaviate's contextionary does not know, you can use the "extensions" endpoint to teach Weaviate the concepts in real-time.

Note that you need to learn Weaviate the new concepts before adding data.

## Usage

An example of using the `/v1/c11y/extensions` endpoint to add or overwrite concepts:

```js
POST /v1/c11y/extensions

{
  "concept": "buried lede",
  "definition": "The central element of an article mistakenly appearing deep in the text",
  "weight": 1
}
```

You can always check if a concept exists in the Contextionary:

```js
GET /v1/c11y/concepts/{concept}
```

For example: 
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/c11y/concepts/buriedLede
```
