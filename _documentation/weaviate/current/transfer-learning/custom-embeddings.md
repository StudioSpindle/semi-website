## Basics

- Custom words or abbreviations (i.e., "concepts") can be added to Weaviate directly by extending the contextionary.
- [Transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning) allows you to extend Weaviate in real-time.
- A `POST` request to the RESTful endpoint `/c11y/extensions` is for extending the contextionary with custom concepts.
- a `GET` request to the RESTful endpoint `/c11y/concepts/{}` returns if a concept is part of the Contextionary. 

## Introduction

It might be the case that your use case contains particular words or abbreviations that Weaviate's contextionary might not know. With the "extensions" endpoint, you can teach Weaviate the concepts in real-time.

Note that you need to learn Weaviate the new concepts before adding data.

## Usage

An example of using the `/v1/c11y/extensions` endpoint to add or overwrite concepts:

```js
POST /v1/c11y/extensions

{
  "concept": "buried lede",
  "definition": "The central element of an article mistakenly appearing deep in the text",
  "weight": 1
}
```

You can always check if a concept exists in the Contextionary:

```js
GET /v1/c11y/concepts/{concept}
```

For example: 
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/c11y/concepts/buriedLede
```
