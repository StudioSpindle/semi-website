# Contextionary Guide

{% include badges.html %}

Weaviate has a contextionary endpoint which you can call to see how it indexed words and concepts.

## Index

- [Basics](#basics)
- [Find concepts](#find-concepts)
- [FAQ](#faq)

## Basics

- You can use this functionality to see how Weaviate functions under the hood.
- All contextionary functionality is consolidated inside Weaviate itself, which means that in practice you will probably not need this end-point often.
- The more training data is available to create the contextionary the better, and the latest versions are trained on the following corpus-sizes;
    - English (8.7G en-corpus.txt)
    - German (3.8G de-corpus.txt)
    - Dutch (1.1G nl-corpus.txt)

## Find concepts

To find a concept you can run the following request.

```js
GET /v1/c11y/concepts/{CamelCasedWords}
```

Examples;

```js
GET /v1/c11y/concepts/apple
```

or

```js
GET /v1/c11y/concepts/appleIphone
```

which results in (depending on the current C11y) something like;

```json
