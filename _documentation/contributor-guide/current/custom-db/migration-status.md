## Global Limits

|Area|Limit|Reason|Mitigation|
|--|--|--|--|
|HNSW object limit| `10,000` | The index is created with a fixed size as opposed to dynamically growing it | [#1219](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate/issues/1219) |
|Index object limit| `ca 4M` | Currently only one shard is supported, the shard uses uint32 as internal ids, so we can't add more than the maximum number| [#1219](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate/issues/1219) |
