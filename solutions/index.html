            <p>Goal of this section: Show that there are different industries.</p>
            <p>End solutions are industry specific. Weaviate is making this possible.</p>
            <p>Key: Instead of x amount of time, using weaviate enables you to only focus on using it...</p>
            <p>Always use Weaviate, then: <strong>Out of the box</strong>: Point solutions. <a href="#">See all point solutions</a></p>

            <p>Goal of this section: Answers the question what point solutions are available, and what point solutions are.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In Forbes 500, 95% of CTO's mention that with the data they have they can't solve a business problem. Put the data in Weaviate and build on top of that. (restructure data)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>New way of looking at data: Capturing all the data from the research, that works. Next step: "We have all these fields which is organised in tables. This is where Weaviate comes in. When you want to organize the data differently, and make other connections, this enables Weaviate.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Point solutions are created to solve one specific problem. Point solutions are focused and therefore are best in class examples in their field. You can make use of pre-existing point solutions which have proven value.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>"This is done at the API level. Not in the UI. The UI level, is client specific."</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Layer five: User Interface (the client can build whatever in this layer)</li>
                <li>Layer four: Point solution(s)</li>
                <li>Layer three: Productize</li>
                <li>Layer two: Consultancy (help  client build their own point solution or ui)</li>
                <li>Layer one: Weaviate</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Some additional feature information:</p>
            <p><strong>It's decentralized:</strong> meaning that clients have the option to "...don't have to send the data away..."</p>
            <p>You need to be able to answer any question using natural language.</p>
