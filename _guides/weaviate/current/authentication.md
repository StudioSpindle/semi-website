# Authentication Guide

If you run Weaviate with an [OpenID authentication scheme](./installation#openid-authentication), you need to send the correct credentials in a request.

## Basics

- By default a Weaviate runs without any form of authentication.
- You need to include a `Bearer` to authenticate.
- The examples assume that Weaviate runs on port 80 on the localhost without authentication.
- The entry point to a Weaviate is always `/v1`.
- [Configure](./installation#openid-authentication) OpenID on a Weaviate instance.
- [Learn more about OpenID](http://openidexplained.com/)

## OpenID details

You can request all details needed from the following endpoint:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost/v1/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

## Add a Bearer to a request

When you've received a Bearer, you can authenticate in the following manner where `{Bearer}` is the bearer-code.

```bash
# List all things with a Bearer
$ curl http://localhost/v1/things -H "Authorization: Bearer {Bearer}"
```
