<a id="KG">Scalable knowledge graph</a>
<p>A Knowledge Graph is a way to connect data points together using relationships to build a network that is searchable like searching the internet. A KG allows you to make new discoveries by searching the entire set of information for the data you want. Traditional solutions require pre-built queries so the users can only search what the system has been programmed to allow them to search. Conventional solutions not scale cheaply. Weaviate scales naturally and easily up from 100,000 nodes to billions if needed.

<a id="peertopeer">Weaviate peer-to-peer network</a>
<p>A unique feature of Weaviate is the networking functionality. You can connect two distinct Weaviate instances together from different organisations and take advantage of both datasets at once, as though they were one Weaviate. This networking is completely custom and secure for both parties. You can share as much or as little of your data as you want to get maximum advantage of the share data and not disclose data you don’t want to share</p>

<a id="deployment">Large-scale deployment tools for your own cloud solution or on-premise</a>
<p>SeMI has tools to deploy your dataset (however large) wherever you choose. This can be in your own cloud, a commercial cloud or on premise.</p>

<a id="contextionary">Create custom Contextionaries</a>
<p>This is a combination of natural-language based AI tools that takes all the data in your Weaviate and interprets context and meaning. This means that if you have the word “Apple” in the data of your electronics store Weaviate understands it to be the company and not the fruit. Words are given context, so it is clear what is meant. This transforms your raw data into powerful knowledge which can be queried in immensely complex ways with simple natural language</p>
<p>Contextualized data creates multiple use cases from a single data set. Weaviate has a built-in Contextionary which has been trained on vast quantities of public data sources including Wikipedia; that means it can interpret your data and to give it context. If needed we can create custom Contextionaries for businesses or domains with specific complex syntax like law, medicine and engineering.</p>
<p>The Contextionary is in constant development and will be enhanced over time. New features will always become available to all customers without extra cost.
