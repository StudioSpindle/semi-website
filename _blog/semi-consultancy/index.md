## Biggest bang for your buck
It is important to understand the business opportunity that you want to address. We do not want to “do big data” for the sake of doing it, but rather look for opportunities that have a real impact on your business. We work with you to discover, define and deploy your first Weaviate use case.

## Exploration workshop
We usually kick off by offering you an exploration workshop to understand where your business challenges meet Weaviate opportunities. In this workshop we introduce our Weaviate software and develop your most promising use cases.

The outcome of the workshop will enable further steps like:

Alignment of your internal stakeholders. Who are the people that need to be involved in the program? What are their respective roles? Achieve agreement on the highest priority use case.
Definition of a Proof of Concept. What exactly do we aim to achieve? When are we successful?
Input into business cases. Which data sources are needed to achieve the desired outcome? Who has access to these sources?

## Ontology
Next we help you define your ontology. This is a key step in the process, because a good ontology will not just help you tackle this particular use case, but also other use case that you may want to explore.

## Setup in your favorite cloud flavor
We help you deploy our software in your favorite cloud flavor: Google, Azure, AWS, VPC, or on premise: the choice is yours. Of course, we can also deploy Weaviate for you.

## Application Development
Our solution engineers can help you develop your use case applications.
